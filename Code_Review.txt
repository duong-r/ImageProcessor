CODE REVIEW

DESIGN
Overall, this design is very cohesive and follows many of the object-oriented design patterns
and principles that we learned in class. The classes in this code all serve a valid purpose
and there are no classes which seem redundant or out of place. There aren't any unnecessary
complications with the design and this makes the code fairly easy to understand.
